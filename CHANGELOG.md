**Implemented Enhancements:**  
- Anticipate updates from Erin and Robert [#](link to PR) (thanks to @user)  
- Added emits to allow linking of workflows to close [#42](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/issues/42) [#e32132d](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/e32132dffc656214a9977ab6c0b22efb86f72f6f).  
- Nick to add information on MLST check and fix changes for both PHOENIX and CDC_PHOENIX (also note file names changes)  
- Maria to add information on -entry SCAFFOLDS  
- Addition of üî•üêéüê¶üî• GRiPhin: General Report Pipeline from PHoeNIx output to `-entry CDC_PHOENIX` [#6291e9c](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/6291e9c6a90d28a61fb45e708536a9588a3d47a3). This was implemented to replace common report generated internally, which is why it is only in the `-entry CDC_PHOENIX`.  
- Changes to allow relative paths for kraken2 and BUSCO database to be passed rather than it requiring it to be a full path [#ecb3618](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/ecb3618a71e6b06a94f6282ee7220b88912d80e7) and [#d938a64](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/d938a6437f3e192dbe8af648c4400011fa0744e4).  

**Output File Changes:**  
- Removed spaces in header of *_all_genes.tsv file from AMRFinder+ output and replace with underscore to allow for more friendly parsing [#fd048d1](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/fd048d1a54ca262617eeef32d85cd4f47650af23).  
- Fixed error causing PROKKA output to not be in Annotation folder [#d014aa0](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/d014aa00b27c1fa9e2d1b1151bc7f6c44d8a82b3).  
- Nick to add files that had headers added

**Fixed Bugs:**  
- Edit to allow nf-tower to work [#b21d61f](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/b21d61f269212311737dffecd54664d7c8019f09)  
- Fixed pipeline failure when prokka throws error for sample names being too long (Error: ID must <= 37 chars long) [#e48e01f](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/e48e01fbac298541f55e949e8e8f04396aa791e8). Now sample name length doesn't matter.  
- Fixed bug where samples wouldn't end up in the `Phoenix_Output_Report.tsv` due to srst2 not finding any AR genes so the file wasn't created. Now blank file is created and remaining sample informatin is in the `Phoenix_Output_Report.tsv` [#2f52edc](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/2f52edc218716404b37a1e1470234e2aa32e82b3). This change only occured in `-entry CDC_PHOENIX`.  
- Fixed issue where `cp` error was thrown when relative path was given for output directory [#0c0ca55](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/0c0ca554861b7da28567694adc0920a6d8046d5b) and [#d938a64](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/commit/d938a6437f3e192dbe8af648c4400011fa0744e4).  

**Database Updates:**  
- AMRFinderPlus database is now static and included in the database folder [#](). We removed the automatic updating for more control of the pipeline and lockdown to prepare for possible CLIA requirements. 

**Container Updates:**  
- Description of containers that were updated [#](links to new version) 
- AMRFinderPlus was updated from 3.10.40 to 3.11.2. Necessary because new amrfinder database could not be downloaded without it >v3.11.
- For folks running PHoeNIx on Terra the container for that add the following additions
    - anaconda::urllib2
    - 
- Scripts the utilize the phoenix_base container were updated to `quay.io/jvhagey/phoenix:base_v1.1.0` which had the python library `xlsxwriter` added to it for [`GRiPHin.py`](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/blob/v1.0.1/bin/GRiPHin.py).
