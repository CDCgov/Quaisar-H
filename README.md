ðŸš¨ðŸš§ **This software is currently under active development and states not part of the beta testing are advised to use with caution as it is likely to change often until there is an offical stable release (estimated Sep 2022).** ðŸš§ðŸš¨

For full documentation on the pipeline see the [Wiki](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki), but quick start instructions are provided below if you are feeling brave. 

## Quick Start

Make sure you are in the 1.0.0-dev branch:

![Changing_Branch](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/blob/main/images/Changing_Branch.PNG)

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`). **This will require a version of Anaconda to be installed on your system.**

    ```console
    mamba create -n nextflow -c bioconda -c conda-forge nf-core=2.2 nextflow=21.10.6 git=2.35.0 openjdk=8.0.312 graphviz
    ```

2. Install [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility.

3. Clone the PHoeNIx Repository from GitHub.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix
    ```

4. Unzip mash sketch in assets folder:

   ```console
   gunzip phoenix/assets/databases/REFSEQ_20210820_Bacteria_complete.msh.gz
   ```

5. Email HAISeq@cdc.gov, with the subject line "krakenDB invite request" to request access to the sharefile link and provide the email address to send invite to.

6. Download the `hash.k2d` file needed for kraken2 from the CDC sharefile link. At this time this is not downloadable via command line . You will need to downloaded the file and place it into into the databases directory, `$PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO/assets/databases`.

Here the `$PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO` needs to be changed to your correct path. 

7. Activate the nextflow environment with:  

   ```console
   conda activate nextflow
   ```

8. Run PHoeNIx on a test sample loaded with the package with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run $PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO/phoenix/main.nf -profile <singularity/docker/custom>,test 
    ```

Note that we aren't cloning (downloading) the repo with this command just pulling directly. See [wiki](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/wiki/Dependencies-and-Install#run-phoenix) for how to clone and have the software locally. 

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker` and `singularity` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
 

9. Start running your own analysis with a [samplesheet](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki/Running-PHoeNIx#samplesheet-input)!

    ```console
    nextflow run phoenix/main.nf -profile <singularity/docker/custom> --input <path_to_samplesheet.csv>
    ```
