ðŸš¨ðŸš§ **This software is currently under active development and states not part of the beta testing are advised to use with caution as it is likely to change often until there is an offical stable release (estimated early Sep 2022).** ðŸš§ðŸš¨

For full documentation on the pipeline see the [Wiki](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki), but quick start instructions are provided below if you are feeling brave. 

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. [Download the pipeline](https://github.com/cdcent/Quaisar-H/wiki/Dependencies-and-Install#install-quaisar-h) and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run CDCgov/phoenix -profile test,YOURPROFILE
    ```

    Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` and are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues, then you can use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, you can use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Download [mini Kraken2 V2 database](ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/kraken2_dbs/old/minikraken2_v2_8GB_201904.tgz) and add the path to `k2db` parameter in the [nextflow.config](https://github.com/DHQP/QuAISAR_Nextflow/blob/ffbaa13eac72a586568010a7e8bec2a3e9cb2c01/nextflow.config#L30) file. This is an 8GB folder so depending on your internet speed this could take awhile. Remember to unzip this folder to allow the program access to the files inside you can unzip it with `tar -xvzf minikraken2_v2_8GB_201904.tgz`. 

5. Download `REFSEQ_20210820_Bacteria_complete.msh` from DHQPs FTP site. 

6. Start running your own analysis with a [samplesheet](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki/Running-PHoeNIx#samplesheet-input)!

    ```console
    nextflow run CDCgov/phoenix -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv
    ```
